    - Open Command Prompt
    - Type the following command and press Enter:
        For my System :
            del /S /Q "D:\DSA\*.exe"


        --> Syntax: del /S /Q "D:\path\to\folder\*.exe"

    - /S: Delete files from all subfolders
    - /Q: Quiet mode, do not ask if ok to delete on global wildcard
    - "C:\path\to\folder\*.exe": Delete all files with .exe extension in the folder and all subfolders

METHOD 2 : Create a .bat file

    - Open Notepad
    - Copy and paste the following command:

@echo off
:: Deletes all .exe files in D:\DSA and its subdirectories
echo Deleting all .exe files in D:\DSA...
del /S /Q "D:\DSA\*.exe"

:: Confirmation message
echo Deletion complete.
pause

    - Save the file with a .bat extension (e.g., delete_exe_files.bat)
    - Double-click the .bat file to run it
