#SECOND LARGEST ELEMENT

Problem Statement: Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array.
                    Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

    Input : [1,2,4,7,7,5]
    Output : Second Smallest : 2
             Second largest  : 5

--> Brute Force Approach
        Approach:
            1. Sort the array in ascending order.
            2. The element present at the second index is the second smallest element.
            3. The element present at the second index from the end is the second largest element.

        Complexity Analysis:
            Time Complexity : O(NlogN) - For sorting the array
            Space Complexity: O(1)
