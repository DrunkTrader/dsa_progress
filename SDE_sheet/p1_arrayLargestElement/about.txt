# Largest Element in an Array

Problem Statement: Given an array, find the largest element in the array
Input: arr[] ={2,5,1,3,0}
Output: 5

--> Brute Approach 
    Approach : 
        1. Sort the array in ascending order.
        2. Print the (size of the array - 1)^th index.
    
    Complexity Analysis:
        Time Complexity: O(N*log(N))
        Space Complexity: O(n)

--> Optimal Approach
    Approach:
        1. Set the first element as the largest element.
        2. Use a for loop and compare it with other elements of the array
        3. If any element is greater than the max value, update max value with the elementâ€™s value.
        4. Print the max variable.

    Complexity Analysis:
        Time Complexity: O(N)
        Space Complexity: O(1)
